a song_notes_1 method. so we can have different inputs but create a method that
grabs the different inputs and associates them with the song.
# work from the form, to the contoller to the model. grab the notes from the params -->

<!-- the first argument represents what method you want to work with -->
<!-- its genre id because thats how the song calls its genre, and its declared already.
the second is where you want to grab the selection from.maybe can use an array? the third
third is the value of each individual selection. thats what will be passed to your paramsif the
selection is made. the value will be passed. The user won't see this. so it makes sense for it
to be the id. -->
